        <h3>Meet Tom</h3>
        <p>
          Tom has a superhuman level of elasticity. Tom is usually defeated in
          the end (or very rarely, killed, like in Mouse Trouble, where he
          explodes), although there are some stories where he outwits and
          defeats Jerry.

        <h3>Meet Jerry</h3>
        <p>
          Jerry Mouse is a rodent featured in the famous Hanna-Barbera-produced
          Tom & Jerry cartoons. Due to his mischievous knack for heckling his
          rival Tom, Jerry has in recent years garnered a variety of Internet
          "troll" memes.
